            Programming is my passion, but I also love math and anything else involving computers. I got started 7 years ago by learning Python and have since picked up several other languages, including JavaScript, Lua, and Rust (my favorite). You can find some of the projects I have released below.

the library is to minimize or maximize the value of an arbitrary function. It also implements
